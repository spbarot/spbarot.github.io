title: Lab 1 - Artemis Processor
---
## I. Objective
The goal of this lab is to configure the Sparkfun RedBoard Artemis Nano Board (microcontroller) and the Arduino IDE. Upon verifying the system functionality, the experimenters shall compile and upload example code (with modifications) such as Blink It Up, Serial, AnalogRead, and MicrophoneOutput. Lastly, ECE 5960 students shall develop a program to enable the on-board LED when the microphone senses a whistle. Refer to the Sparkfun RedBoard Artemis Nano datasheet and Artemis setup instructions in the appendix section for preliminary information required for the lab. 

## II. Materials/Software
* 1x SparkFun RedBoard Artemis Nano
* 1x USB A to C Cable
* Arduino IDE (Software)

## III. Procedure/Design/Results

  ### III.I. System Setup
  First download and install the Arduino IDE. Then, Interconnect the Artemis and the computer via the USB cable. Once the program is installed, hover to Tools and select Boards Manager. Download and install the Sparkfun Apollo 3 Boards package. 

  ### III.II. Blink It Up Example
  Once the system is setup, select File, Examples, 01. Basics and open Blink. Analyze the software and select Upload on the toolbar. 
The Blink program enables the on-board blue LED. As per the algorithm, the LED is toggled on and off every 1000 milliseconds. Note that the LED on/off frequency can be modified by adjusting the delay. The video showcases a delay of 100 milliseconds, increasing the on/off frequency. The on-board LED is an extremely useful tool when debugging and verifying software functionalities.
