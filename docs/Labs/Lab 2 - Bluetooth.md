## I. Objective

The goal of this lab is to configure and establish Bluetooth communication between the computer and the Artemis board. Lab tasks involve installing and configuring a virtual environment, python, and Jupyter, configuring Bluetooth communication between the computer and the Artemis board, sending and receiving string/float values, and creating a notification handler.
