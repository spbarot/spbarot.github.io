## Course Description:
ECE 5960 - Design and Implementation of Fast Robots focuses on systems level design and implementation of dynamic autonomous robots. The course revolves around designing and building a fast autonomous car, while exploring reactive control on an embedded processor, sensors, dynamic behaviors, and acting forces. The topics covered include embedded systems design using C++ and Python, robot controls, sensors (passive/active), signal processing and filtering, communication (bluetooth, i2C, serial), and planning and search algorithms.
